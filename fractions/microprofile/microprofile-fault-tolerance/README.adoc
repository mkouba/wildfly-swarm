= Microprofile Fault Tolerance Fraction
:icons: font

This fraction implements the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance[Eclipse Microprofile Fault tolerance API^].
The implementation relies on <<_hystrix,Hystrix fraction>> which is added transitively into your application.
You can leverage <<configuring-a-wildfly-swarm-application,standard configuration mechanisms>> to fine-tune Hystrix properties.

== @Bulkhead @Fallback rejection

If semaphore-style `Bulkhead` with `Fallback` is used to limit the number of concurrent requests it could happen that the invocation may still result in `BulkheadException` due to the maximum concurrent limit for `HystrixCommand.getFallback()` is hit.
In this case, `swarm.hystrix.command.default.fallback.isolation.semaphore.maxConcurrentRequests` property can be used to increase the limit.
